Codeboard
=========

Codeboard is an online MOOC class used for introductory programming (C/C++/Java/Python). This system is currently in use at FAMU for the Fundamentals of programming labs. 

My goal of this system is for it to be robust in terms of programming languages, easily configurable, simple for instructors and students and just simply works.

This is still in the works so contact me for more info or if you would like to use it and need my help.
